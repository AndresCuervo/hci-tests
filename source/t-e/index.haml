    If you drag your mouse over the blue, underlined "10" below you can observe the probabilities change.

  %p
    Say we randomly generate a number between 1 and 20.
  %p
    The probability the generated number is in the range of [1 to
    %span.TKAdjustableNumber{"data-var" => "firstIntervalLimit", "data-min" => "1", "data-max" => "19"}
    ] is:
    %br
    -# %span{"data-var" => "fractionalProbability"}
    %span{"data-var" => "firstIntervalLimit"}
    \/20
    %br
  %p
    The probability of being in the next range: [
    %span{"data-var" => "nextLowBound"}
    to 20], is:
    %br
    %span{"data-var" => "reverseFraction"}
      \/20.
